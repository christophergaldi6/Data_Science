# Data Science 
### CPSC 392 
These are a collection of projects and assignments that were created using Jupyter Notebooks to utilize data science measures such as Linear Regression, Logistical Regression, K-Means, Clustering, and other methods to analyze data. 

## FIFA Project

A data science project that looked at the varied spread of players, their club, and the nation they play for and the relation between in-game abilities and stats compared to their real-life evaluation. I explored the spread of nations, leagues, clubs, and positions in FIFA 21 and visualized the findings. 
I created Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and LASSO Regression models to predict the overall rating of each player given their in-game stats and created a Linear Regression model to predict the real-life evaluation of a player based on in-game stats, age, and wages of the player. As well, I clustered in-game stats using the Hierarchal Clustering method to determine the overall strengths of players and the general positions that they play.
 
## Diabetes Project #1

A data science project using a Linear Regression model utilizing the K-Fold method to predict BMI of a person and a Logistic Regression model utilizing K-Fold method to predict if a person has been diagnosed with diabetes. 

## Food Analysis Project #2
A data science project using a Logistical Regression model using a Train-Test Split and K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict if a menu item is a burger or pizza based on dietary information, and looked at the menu of Krispy Kreme to cluster the donuts being sold. I visualized the data and results to analyze the spread and contents of the data and the accuracy of the predictions and used scatterplots, confusion matrices, and clustering techniques to analyze the results of the models.

## Homework 1
### Exploring and Visualizing Data

Assignment using Pandas and Numpy libraries to expand the data sets using scatterplots, line graphs, and other strategies and effectively portraying them to analyze. 

## Homework 2
### Linear Regression Models

Assignment using Pandas and Numpy libraries to create linear regression models to predict the BMI and test the accuracy of the models using mean squared error, r2 score, and coefficient evaluation. Through z-scoring and variable manipulation, I was able to use the models to visualize the BMI data to predict body weight. 

## Homework 3
### Logistic Regression Models

Assignment that uses Pandas and Numpy libraries to create logistic regression models to predict admissions and test the accuracy of the models. Using z-scoring and variable manipulation, I was able to predict admissions and other variables while also testing if the models were accurate and precise through logarithmic odds and coefficient evaluation and a confusion matrix to visualize. I also looked at the probability and odds of certain students admissions.  

## Homework 5
### K-Means and Other Clustering Methods

Assignment using Pandas and Numpy libraries to create clustering models for the different profficiency levels of programming languages for each person in the data set. I utilized the K-Means method, the Empirical method, and the Hierarchal Clustering method to determine the clustering of each person for the different programming languages and visualized the findings using scatterplots to show the clustering.
